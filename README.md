# Node-Internals---Team-2

Hi Team, 

I created repository. However, I am learning how to create repository so please bare with me if I have done something wrong. 

As you all aware of the task we have been given for research: "Node internals: Node event loop, Node Core modules, async/sync (non-blocking operation). 

Shall we share tasks: Will talk about it on slack team meeting! 



1. Fork repository
2. Clone it to your machine "git clone (url)"
3. Create branch with your name
4. Add, commit and push your work
5. At the end, do a final push and create a Pull Request.
